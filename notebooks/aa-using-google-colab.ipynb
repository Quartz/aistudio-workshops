For the math part, we'll want a computer with a graphics processing unit (GPU), which are not only really good for high-speed graphics and animation, but are also excellent for training machine learning models.\n",

I like to use use [the Amazon EC2 setup](https://course.fast.ai/start_aws.html), which is probably the most complicated.\n",
